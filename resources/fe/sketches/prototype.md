# Prototype
Following the [outline of design](../design_outline.md) the frontend team created a mockup prototype using Adobe Xd to simulate some main user interactions as well as semi-definitive layout and design features.

Images can be viewed in full resolution in the [src](src) folder.

## Layout
The following demo highlights the main *layout components* as shown in the [outline](../design_outline.md).

## UI workflows

This will be shown through the following workflows:

* [Flow 2 : **Upload** tab](#flow-2--upload)

### Flow 1 : Create
